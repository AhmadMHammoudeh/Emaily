# Emaily

This project uses the 42 School API's to gather information about the students enrolled in the exam for the cursus and randomizes their location based on multiple parameters. The project uses 42 Abu Dhabi labs plan where we have three different labs with different sizes. Some unique sorting methods in this project is that the students are not allowed to sit in the same place they sit in during normal lab time. Then finally an email is sent to the students with thier seats that are generated from the program and a csv file is printed so students can check in the lab.
